== Risks and Technical Debts
=== Possible risks
When implementing the application, risks may arise such as:
[options="header",cols="1,2,1"]
|===
|Risk|Explanation|Solution
| Working in a group | We are not used to working in groups with so many people and on such large projects|Increase communication and keep track of each other's tasks so as not to lose each other
| Github | We have a very small github base | Learning how all github operations work
| Time management | We cannot devote all available time to the project| Try to be organised and communicate in case of time constraints
|New technologies |There are new technologies like Solid or React that we have never used before|Learn the basics of them and help each other to improve learning.

=== Technical Debts


As technical debts we consider that may arise:
[options="header",cols="1,2,1"]
|===
|Technical debt|Explanation|Solution
|Low cohesion |When doing individual work there may be a lack of communication and not being able to connect the work. |Try to make the implementation as joint as possible to avoid these problems
| Robustness |As we have little experience in some technologies, we could get an application with errors in some options|More extensive testing
|Conflicts in github|Sometimes when merging everything together, a series of conflicts can arise that are difficult to resolve|Make good use of the functions provided by github and organise yourself well to prevent them.
