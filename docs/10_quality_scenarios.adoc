=== Evaluation scenarios

_Testability/Coverage_

For this part we will use many tools that allow us to test a 70% at least of our app , also we will do some gatling test in order to test how many requests can the app resist till it breaks .

_Testability/Independet from external sevices_

The architecture should be designed in such a way that algorithms depending on external services can be tested without having the external service available. That is: All external dependencies should be mockable.

_Usability_

The application will be designed in such a way that anyone who can access it will be able to navigate as comfortably as possible.

_Confindenciality_

Clients privacy is respected by using a descentralized delivery following SOLID , in which the user will have a POD where his personal data will be stored so if the app closes the user will still keep his personal information on the POD.
