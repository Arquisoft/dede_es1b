== Cross-cutting Concepts
=== Persistence
We focused on developing an app that uses MERN (MongoDb,Express,React,Node) so we use mongoDb as a container for our data , pods for user personal data and we will use a extern repository for images.

=== Internationalization 
Even though we decided to do the documentation part in english , we also decided that our app would be in spanish,
just to make us easier to focus on the development part.

=== Test 
For this part we will be doing three types of test , unitary ones , which will test only little funcionalities without external dependences , end to end to prove full developed functions of the app , and finally load test to see if the app
stops if the amount of users is high.
