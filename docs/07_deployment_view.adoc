|Node|Description
| DataBase | Database manager, in our case mongodb, which we are going to use to make all our queries.
| Device | Software that we are going to use to display the shop interface, i.e. any browser, preferably a computer browser as it is not perfectly optimised for mobile phones.
| Solid | Place where user data will be stored respecting the privacy and security of the users, using pods to store the information of each user.
| Web server | Host service that allows us to deploy both the restapi application and the webapp, the service we used was Heroku.
